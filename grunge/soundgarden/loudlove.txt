Loud Love
Soundgarden

There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf, now I want noise
You stay down, but I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love

If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well, I know, but that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pulse

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love

Well, that's right, I want something to explode
I've been deaf, now I want noise
