we fell in love in october
girl in red

Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view
We fell in love in October, that's why I love fall
Looking at the stars, admiring from afar

My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my world
My world, my world, my world
You will be my girl

Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view
Don't bother looking down
We're not going that way
At least I know, I am here to stay

We fell in love in October, that's why I love fall
Looking at the stars, admiring from afar
My girl, my girl, my girl

My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my world
My world, my world, my world
You will be my girl
